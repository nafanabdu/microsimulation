**Title: The Impact of a Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax and Increased Physical Activity on Obesity and Diabetes Burden in Eastern EU Countries: A Microsimulation Model**


Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends implementing a 20% sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax and reducing physical inactivity by 15%. (1, 2) Eastern EU countries tend to have higher sugar consumption and lower physical activity levels. (3, 4) This study aims to identify the most effective scenarios for implementing an SSB tax and physical activity (PA) programs to reduce the burden of diabetes in Central and Eastern EU countries (based on EuroVoc classification includes: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and   Slovakia).


Material and Method

•	Input Parameters: Age, Sex, Income level, BMI (weight, height), T2DM incidence, and physical activity level. These baseline parameters were derived from EHIS 2019. 
•	Synthetic Population: Created using weighted sampling to represent the real population. 
•	Microsimulation Model: A discrete-time stochastic microsimulation model consisting of four states: normal weight, overweight, obesity, diabetic, and deceased. The model runs annually from 2020 to 2050. 
•	Outcome Measure: Prevented obesity, T2DM averted, death averted (2020 to 2050). 
•	Model Validation: Internal validation 
•	Sensitivity Analysis: Conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations to provide a 95% uncertainty interval (UI). 

•	Comparative Scenarios: Different scenarios will be analyzed to assess the effects of various interventions:
-	Main Scenario: SSB Tax 20% + PA increase 15% 
-	Comparator Scenarios: 
  1)	SSBs substitution with water
  2)	30% Subsidy on Fruit and Vegetables 

*SSB Tax= Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax, PA= Physical Activity
